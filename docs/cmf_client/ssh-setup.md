# SSH Remote Artifact Repo Setup
## Steps to set up an SSH Remote Repo
SSH (Secure Shell) remote storage refers to using the SSH protocol to securely
access and manage files and data on a remote server or storage system over a
network. SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure
communication and data transfer between a local computer and a remote server.

Proceed with the following steps to set up an SSH Remote Repository:

1. Initialize the `project directory` with an SSH remote.
2. Check whether cmf is initialized in your project directory with the following command.
   ```
   cmf init show
   ```
   If cmf is not initialized, the following message will appear on the screen.
   ```
   'cmf' is not configured.
   Execute the 'cmf init' command.
   ```

3.  Execute the following command to initialize the SSH remote storage as a CMF artifact repository.
    ```
    cmf init sshremote --path ssh://127.0.0.1/home/user/ssh-storage \
        --user XXXXX --port 22 --password example@123 \
        --git-remote-url https://github.com/user/experiment-repo.git \
        --cmf-server-url http://127.0.0.1:80
    ```
    > When running `cmf init sshremote`, ensure that the specified IP address allows access for \
    the specified user XXXX. If the IP address or user does not exist, this command will fail.

4. Execute `cmf init show` to check the CMF configuration.
5. To troubleshoot SSH permissions-related issues, check the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file on the
   remote machine. This configuration file serves as the primary starting point for diagnosing
   and resolving SSH permission-related challenges.
