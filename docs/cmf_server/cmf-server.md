# Getting started with cmf-server

__cmf-server__ is a key interface for the user to explore and track their ML training runs. It allows users to store the metadata file on the cmf-server. The user can retrieve the saved metadata file and can view the content of the saved metadata file using the UI provided by the cmf-server.


## Setup a cmf-server

There are two ways to start cmf server - 

- Using docker compose file
- Using docker run

### Pre-requisites
1. Clone the [Github repository](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/cmf). 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HewlettPackard/cmf
   ```
   
2. Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) with [non root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) privileges.
3. Install [Docker Compose Plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).
   > In earlier versions of docker compose, `docker compose` was independent of docker. Hence, `docker-compose` was command. However, after introduction of Docker Compose Desktop V2, compose command become part of docker engine. The recommended way to install docker compose is installing a docker compose plugin on docker engine. For more information - [Docker Compose Reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/).
4. **Docker Proxy Settings** are needed for some of the server packages. Refer to the official Docker documentation for comprehensive instructions: [Configure the Docker Client for Proxy](https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/#configure-the-docker-client).

## Using `docker compose` file 
> This is the recommended way as docker compose starts cmf-server, postgres db and ui-server in one go. It is neccessary to start postgres db before cmf-server.

1. Go to root `cmf` directory. 
2. Replace `xxxx` with user-name in docker-compose-server.yml available in the root cmf directory.
    ```
    ......
    services:
    server:
      image: server:latest
      volumes:
         - /home/xxxx/cmf-server/data:/cmf-server/data                 # for example /home/hpe-user/cmf-server/data:/cmf-server/data 
         - /home/xxxx/cmf-server/data/static:/cmf-server/data/static   # for example /home/hpe-user/cmf-server/data/static:/cmf-server/data/static
      container_name: cmf-server
      build:
    ....
    ```
  
3. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as `docker-compose-server.yml` and add the necessary environment variables.
   ```
   POSTGRES_USER=myuser
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword
   ``` 
   > 
4. Execute following command to start both the containers. `IP` variable is the IP address and `hostname` is host name of the machine on which you are executing the following command.
   You can use either way.
   ```
   IP=200.200.200.200 docker compose -f docker-compose-server.yml up
              OR
   hostname=host_name docker compose -f docker-compose-server.yml up
   ```
   > Replace `docker compose` with `docker-compose` for older versions.
   > Also you can adjust `$IP` in `docker-compose-server.yml` to reflect the server IP and run the `docker compose` command without specifying 
    IP=200.200.200.200.
     ```
     .......
     environment:
     REACT_APP_MY_IP: ${IP}
     ......
     ```
     
 5. Stop the containers.
    ```
      docker compose -f docker-compose-server.yml stop
    ```

> It is neccessary to rebuild images for cmf-server and ui-server after `cmf version update` or after pulling latest cmf code from git.

## Using `docker run` command

1.  Install [cmflib](../index.md#installation) on your system.

2. Go to `cmf/server` directory. 
   ```
   cd server
   ```
3. List all docker images.
   ```
   docker images
   ```
   
4. Execute the below-mentioned command to create a `cmf-server` docker image.
   ```
   Usage:  docker build -t [image_name] -f ./Dockerfile ../
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   docker build -t server_image -f ./Dockerfile ../
   ```
   `Note` - `'../'`  represents the [Build context](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/) for the docker image.
   
5. Launch a new docker container using the image with directory /home/user/cmf-server/data mounted.
   `Pre-requisite: mkdir /home/<user>/cmf-server/data/static`
   ```
   Usage: docker run --name [container_name] -p 0.0.0.0:8080:80 -v /home/<user>/cmf-server/data:/cmf-server/data -e MYIP=XX.XX.XX.XX [image_name]
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   docker run --name cmf-server -p 0.0.0.0:8080:80 -v /home/user/cmf-server/data:/cmf-server/data -e MYIP=0.0.0.0 server_image
   ```
   
6. After cmf-server container is up, start `ui-server`, Go to `cmf/ui` folder.
   ```
   cd cmf/ui
   ```
   
7. Execute the below-mentioned command to create a `ui-server` docker image.
   ```
   Usage:  docker build -t [image_name] -f ./Dockerfile ./
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   docker build -t ui_image -f ./Dockerfile ./
   ```
   
8. Launch a new docker container for UI.
   ```
   Usage: docker run --name [container_name] -p 0.0.0.0:3000:3000 -e REACT_APP_MY_IP=XX.XX.XX.XX [image_name]
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   docker run --name ui-server -p 0.0.0.0:3000:3000 -e REACT_APP_MY_IP=0.0.0.0 ui_image
   ```
      Note:
      If you face issue regarding `Libzbar-dev` similar to the snapshot, add proxies to '/.docker/config.json'

      ![Screentshot (115)](https://github.com/varkha-d-sharma/cmf/assets/111754147/9830cbe9-bad8-404a-8abe-5470fc2303c4)
   
      ```
      {
         proxies: {
              "default": {
                           "httpProxy": "http://web-proxy.labs.xxxx.net:8080",
                           "httpsProxy": "http://web-proxy.labs.xxxx.net:8080",
                           "noProxy": ".labs.xxxx.net,127.0.0.0/8"
                   }
               }
       }
      ```
   
10. To stop the docker container.
    ```
    docker stop [container_name]
    ```
   
11. To delete the docker container.
    ```
    docker rm [container_name] 
    ```
    
12. To remove the docker image.
    ``` 
    docker image rm [image_name] 
    ```
